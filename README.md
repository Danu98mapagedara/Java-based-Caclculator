# Simple Calculator

This project is a simple calculator application developed using Java's AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit). It provides an intuitive graphical user interface for performing basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, percentage, and square root calculations. The calculator features dark and light themes, a copy-to-clipboard function, and the ability to open multiple calculator windows. This project aims to demonstrate the use of Java AWT components to create a functional and visually appealing desktop application.
